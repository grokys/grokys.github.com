One thing i'm taking from polymer is that i'm splitting controls into two categories:
`Perspex.Controls.Core` and `Perspex.Controls.Standard`.

Core controls are non-templated controls that just display simple stuff, like TextBlock, Border etc.
Standard controls assembly defines the LooklessControl class which adds the templating facility

but also in the core controls i'm adding simple non-styled versions of commonly used controls
so ItemHost is like a ContentControl except it's not got a templated look - it just creates the DataTemplate directly as a child

it also contains Selector which has a Panel property, and maintains a selection of the children of its Panel

again: unstyled, so it just adds a selected class - to display the selected item you'd set a style for the selectedclass
