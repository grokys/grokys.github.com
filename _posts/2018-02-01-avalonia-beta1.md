Avalonia Beta 1 is now [available](http://avaloniaui.net/blog/2018-02-18-avalonia-beta1.html)! This release represents nearly a year's worth of work and I'm very pleased to see it finally out.

That's not to say we've not got a long way to go, but this release represents a huge leap forward for Avalonia. Looking forward the biggest missing piece for the moment is documentation which we hope to start fleshing out now this release is out.

We've now got the beginnings of a website up over at [avaloniaui.net](http://avaloniaui.net) and you can read the [full release announcement](http://avaloniaui.net/blog/2018-02-18-avalonia-beta1.html) there.
